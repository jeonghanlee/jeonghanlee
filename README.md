- :sound: Pronouns: /haan/

- A Ph.D.-level **Technical Lead** and **Systems Architect** with over 15 years of international experience leading the design, development, and implementation of mission-critical control systems for world-leading scientific facilities. Proven ability to direct technical teams and architect complex solutions for particle accelerators and light sources in the United States, Sweden, and South Korea. A strategic problem-solver skilled at modernizing legacy systems and creating robust software environments from the ground up.

+ Directed control system teams and projects for major international facilities , serving as Technical Lead for the ALS-U Controls Group (USA) , Hardware Integration Work Lead at the European Spallation Source, ERIC (Sweden) , and Group Leader for the Rare Isotope Science Project, IBS (South Korea).

+ Architected multiple critical control system frameworks, including the European Spallation Source EPICS Environment (e3) and the ALS-U EPICS Environment , grounded in a deep understanding of experimental physics forged through direct contributions to parity-violating experiments (A4 and Qweak) and the design and construction of their essential instrumentation, such as the A4 Compton Backscattering Polarimeter.

+ Delivered end-to-end technical solutions across the full technology stack , from designing controls networks and middleware services to developing CI/CD workflows and managing Linux server infrastructure.

+ :scientist: He has spent his time understanding very small things, which most people don't care about, such as the chrial quark model, [the strange quark contribution to a proton structure](https://www.jlab.org/research/strange_quarks), and [the weak charge of a proton](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05037-9) within [the Standard Model](https://home.cern/science/physics/standard-model). While doing them, he spends his time fo fix very small things, which most people don't care about, such as few byte memory leakages, to solve the equation of motion of wire scanner, to reassemble recycle dipole magnets, to save super expensive beam-on time, even if it is less than 10 mins, with various automation tools and procedures, to fix silly bugs (e.g., hit enter only twice, then crash) in various scripts, to minimize the measurement statistical and systematic errors, to analyze strange multi-hit histogram from particle tracking system with the [stable marriage algorithm](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem), that [Nobel Prize in Economics](
https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2012/summary/) was awarded, to find many typos and missing information in many technical reference books for various hardware from various vendors.  

+ :man: He plays a fork guitar :guitar: from time to time and loves to brew a cup of coffee :coffee: by hand-operated grain mills. His favorite coffee is the Starbucks Pike place. He has a small dream that to be at [the Pike place market](https://goo.gl/maps/Pib42iBvtpr7abo97) and to drink a cup of the Pike place. And  He loves **Debian** Linux :penguin:.

+ :smiley: He is currently working on an ongoing upgrade project of the Advanced Light Source (ALS) at [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://als.lbl.gov/)
